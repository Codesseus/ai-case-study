# Clarifai AI Case Study

## Overview and Origin

Clarifai was founded in 2013 by Matthew Zeiler. He was inspired to start the company by his desire to change the world using AI.[^1] [^2] In a 2016 post on the company's blog Matthew Zeiler talked about why the company was founded:[^3]

> Clarifai was founded in 2013 . . . to solve real-world problems with AI, starting with visual recognition. We've always believed that AI can augment human intelligence to transform how businesses and developers build apps and create user experiences.

Clarifai recieves its funding through investors. They have had three waves of funding (Series A funding in 2015,[^4] Series B in 2016,[^3] and Series C in 2021[^2]) and have raised around one hundred million dollars. Their investors mostly consist of companies and investment firms such as NVIDIA and CPP Investments.[^1]

## Business Activities

Clarifai is creating AI tools, especially in the computer vision space, to allow businesses and developers to create new solutions to problems they face. Their primary customers are other businesses and the government.[^5]

Clarifai competes in its field by offering their solutions for cheaper,[^6] and by providing a service that larger ai companies don't, a guarantee that the data used to train the models will not be used to build a competing product.[^7]

The company is currently using deep learning to process image data in a variety of computer vision tasks including image analysis, pattern recognition, and facial recognition.[^8] They are also using generative ai and large learning models[^9] to predict patterns (such as failures in manufacturing plants[^10]), and natural language processing to "discover customer insights"[^11] in the retail space.

## Landscape

Clarifai is mostly a computer vision company. From personal experience I can say that in the last 5-10 years the computer vision industry has been transitioning away from traditional vision algorithms towards AI. Within the field of AI computer vision, deep learning has been on of the major drivers of the technology.[^12]

Clarifai largely competes with other computer vision companies (or other companies in the computer vision space) such as Amazon,[^13] Google,[^7] and Adobe.[^6] It also competes with firms using ai in other ways such as mediafly (who uses ai to create predictions for sales).[^6] [^14]

## Results

Clarifai made an impact on the computer vision field by being an early ai company who was providing its solutions to other third party companies. 

Computer vision companies generally measure success by the accuracy of their solutions. In 2017 Clarifai was on par, and in some cases more accuate, with its big tech competitors Google, IBM, and Microsoft.[^7] 

Since 2017 I was unable to find a direct comparison, but considering their continued growth, and a lack of articles saying they were falling behind, it is safe to say that they have continued to stay on par with their competitors.

## Recommendations

I would advise Clarifai to provide a general consumer version of their image recognition platform, so that the average person could upload and quickly sort through their personal photos using the same technology that Clarifai already uses for third party companies to sort their inventories. 

The advantage to Clarifai would be good will and name recognition of the comapny which could lead to further interest in investment in the future. This solution would also be relatively cheap to implement since it would not require any new AI technology to be developed instead relying on their already exisitng deep learning algorithms that work with untagged data. This solution would be good for the average user since it should not require them to learn much in the way of AI development but would largely consist in only uploading their photographs. 

The main cost and new development they would need to do would be in providing a more robust webpage and support team to handle regular customers.
